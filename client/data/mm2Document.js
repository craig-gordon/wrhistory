      only 4 seconds faster than nou1.`

      dream, a time under 26:40 for Rockman 2. He may have lost the race vs Ello to the first 26 
      back in 2014, but he was determined to be the first to 3x, and so he was. Despite 
      accomplishing the dream goal he and Ello fantastized about in previous years, cyghfer 
      asserts that 26:2x is the final frontier for Rockman 2. Only time will tell the truth of 
      that assertion.`
