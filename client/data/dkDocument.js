      While Copeland "retired" from the game and rested on his laurels, Lakeman eventually retaliated with a 
      staggering 1.23 score, proving that the Donkey Kong high score can always be beaten with enough tenacity. 
      Incredibly, Lakeman achieved this score on his first credit of that day's session, streaming his gameplay 
      on Facebook.`
